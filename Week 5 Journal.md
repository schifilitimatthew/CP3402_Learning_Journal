# Week 5

# Learning Activities

For the learning activities this week, I had to learn how to use parent and child themes. So in order to achieve this I re-read the content as suggested in the practical. The content gave my helpful advice on things such as how to format my css correctly (using commas going down for multiple sections with the same style) and gave me a rough guide on what to expect in the practical. When I actually did the task, all was fine at the start. I was able the find the correct file directory and create my child theme folder and files. But for some reason both the php code from the content and on the website that was provided for assistance didn’t work. As a result, I look externally for a solution. That is where I found a YouTube video that use the same css structure but a different php structure that worked for me.

# Estimated Hours

Overall, 4 hours

# Content Insights

In the week's content I learnt that themes are used to style websites have child themes so when the theme gets updated the customisation previously applied don’t reset with it. Its is also possible to have multiple children with the same parents.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learnt that time management is a vital aspect of learning. This week I had very busy week with Content Management Systems Assessment added on top of more usual very busy schedule. I decided to get it done as soon a possible, prioritising it above other subject practicals and this own. As a result, I finished the assessment early Friday which was good in one sense but bad in another. Being four large third year practicals need to be done by Sunday midnight. I was able to complete two by Saturday but prior commitment with family limited my time further. I made the consensus call for this subject to go last as I completed its assessment this week which effected my other subjects. I completed all but this practical by the deadline. I am currently not sure if I made the right decision or not but if I were to change this week I would of try to beak up the assessment a bit more doing other subjects. This may have helped with my problem-solving blocks and may have saved time in the future.
