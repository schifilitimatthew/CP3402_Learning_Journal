# Week 7

# Learning Activities

For the learning activities this week, I had to write and run PHP code to demonstrate your understanding of the features/skills such as Echo, Decisions, Repetition, Functions and Include. In order to achieve this task, I first needed to download software to run and create php documents so as a result I installed PhpStorm. After installation I forked the recommended The Advice Shop site to use as a guide and rewatched last week videos to clear up my understanding. Using these resources constructed a php version of Greenswords Inc (also the business previously used for practicals and assessment) which focus of php implementation over design.
# Resources/Links

# Estimated Hours

Overall, 5 hours

# Content Insights

In the week's content I learnt that rewatching the same videos at extended lengths helps with remembering the content inside of the videos. This occurred as a result of watch the video once the week before the practical, once the week of and once the week later (as a result of the two period the complete this task).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learnt that taking a break is very importing in terms of learning productivity. Recently I had been under a lot of pressure as a result of constant assessments being due on top of the regular work load for the last three weeks before going into lecture recess. This resulted in myself making the personal call to take a complete week off from any university work to relax and to recharge. This proved to be highly effective as I felt motivation going into the rest of this practical (as I took a break during it’s partial completion).
