# Week 12

# Learning Activities

For the learning activities this week, I learnt different presentation techniques in order to the audience engaged in the presented topic. One technique I used during the practice presentation was the minimalistic approach to avoid the audience from being distracted as well as keeping eye contact and present confidently throughout.

# Content Insights

During this practical I learnt that time management is going to be a key factor when making the actual presentation for the assessment. This insight was made due to the amount of scheduling required in order to produce this practice video. During this practical our group was more concerned about doing the actual assessment therefore we only sent a day on this presentation. We form a plan of recording our separate parts and giving them to me at 9pm to edit them together. This became more stressful when people didn’t hand stuff in on time leaving me with less time to edit the video properly. So, in order to avoid this issue in the future the time people will give me their video will be a lot sooner for possibility for this to happen again.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learnt that doing a practice runs in future events inside or outside university will be highly beneficial in the long run as in identify issues that need to be fixed and establishes a structure that people can be familiar with.
