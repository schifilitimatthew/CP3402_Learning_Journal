# Week 6

# Learning Activities

For the learning activities this week, I had to form my group based on my interviews in previous weeks and on who people I thought would work best with and whom are available. After the group was decided we established a main method of communication being discord. Afterwards we all joined a call to establish different teamwork tools we will use to complete the project for assessment 2. These tools are Trello, GitHub and Discord/Slack. Trello being used for planning and assigning jobs. A GitHub project to post and keep record of our project. Discord as our main source of communication despite being required to use slack which has a link to our discord channel. After this was decided we filled out the Group Agreement & Contact in Trello.

# Content Insights

In the week's content I learnt that planning at the start is a more important step in terms of group work. This is so everyone is one the same page and has a base idea of what to work of on. Instead of individual project where initial planning is still important but later focuses on how to improvise with the new content available.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learnt that trusting your team members is important. After falling sick earlier this week, it really messed up my schedule resulting in me missing meetings and lectures for subjects. Lucky enough I was healthy enough to participate is this subject’s meeting but for other subjects I had to give notice I would be away and catch up on what I missed. This really stressed me out as I never miss meetings as I consider them to be the most important part of group productivity and normally, I’m the one who keeps the meeting on track and organised. After the meeting was conducted as soon as I was able to be health enough to work, I immediately asked what I missed during the meeting. To my surprise I heard and saw they completed the work they needed to do for the previous week and starting working on something else. Admittedly overall it didn’t seem very productive but what impressed me was their ability to make a big call being rescheduling meetings to focus on the test the following week. This allowed to respect and trust my team members a bit more.
