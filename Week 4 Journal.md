# Week 4

# Learning Activities

For the learning activities this week, I learnt how to install and create a localhost domain. This was when I watched a YouTube video a week before for a previous practical which allowed me to download and install WordPress. As for Joomla I used scotchbox and vagrant to produce a local host. Then was I produced a website through to localhost I learnt how to deploy the local website. For WordPress I used a combination of a plugin and AWS's EC3 and as for Joomla I use AWS's LightSail. This was used to demonstrate I was able to produce dynamic site with a database. Then when it was completed showed proof with a screenshot and wrote a description on how I achieved it.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learnt that early preparation can lead to good things as I completed the majority of this practical early as I did practical 2 and 3 as we were given warning, we had to use local hosts in our assessment and practical later on. As a result, I reaped the rewards this week allow me to focus on other things in a very busy week.
