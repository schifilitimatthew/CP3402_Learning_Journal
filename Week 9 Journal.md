For the learning activities this week, I had to learn and implement sass and edit the previous practicals code to demonstrate your understanding of the features/skills such as variables, nesting, mixins and extend/inheritance. In order to achieve this task, I first needed to download node.js to be able to install sass as ruby is now deprecated. After installation that the php terminal using npm install -g sass.

# Content Insights

In the week's content I learnt that watching external video for assistance isn’t always going to work. During this week to main issue, I had was trying to install sass. As it was never really covered in the lecture videos, I referred to external video sources on how to install it. However, the majority of the videos were old and said to used ruby which was no longer available. After a while I referred back to the lecture slides to see the alternate method to install sass and after more research and installing node.js I was able to use sass for the website.

This information will assist me in the future so I don’t get stuck doing the same thing for to long with no results.
